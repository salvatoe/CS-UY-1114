## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal notes, rewritten examples, and practice exercises created while taking CS-UY 1114.

It follows the structure of the NYU course, covering topics such as:

* Variables and expressions
* Strings
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions
* Lists, tuples, dictionaries
* File input and output
* Exception handling
* Classes and objects
* Basic data structures
* Testing and debugging

The goal is to provide an organized, accessible, and student-friendly companion to the course material.

## Purpose of This Companion

This project is designed for students who want:

* Additional explanations beyond lecture slides
* Extra practice questions
* Clear and simplified notes
* Rewritten examples with detailed comments
* A way to review for lab exams, midterms, and the final
* A beginner-friendly learning path through the course material

The notes emphasize clarity, step-by-step reasoning, and common mistakes, making them ideal for students with little or no prior programming experience.
